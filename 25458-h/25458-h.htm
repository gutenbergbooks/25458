<span class="i2">A notable provision.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her neighbours round esteemed her well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And often in her little cell,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Would spend a social hour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides, she had a friendly heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the poor she would impart<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some of her little store.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, Madam Mouse two sons had got,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One named Streak,&mdash;the other, Spot;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She gave them education,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And also taught them to excel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all such arts as fitted well<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Two prettier Mice were never seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So soft, so nimble, and so clean;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their teeth were sharp, their eyes were bright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when through wood she saw them gnaw<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The mother's eyes beamed with delight.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Not thinking at all how for him she would grieve.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Jack, "Brother Bob for his pleasure has strayed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll roam away, too, when I'm nicely arrayed:"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next morn he set off in a hat and wig dressed;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same that the farmer's son wore as his best.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">With snout aloft, he started out,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then on the green he gazed about:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He whisked his tail with pure delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying&mdash;"I shall not lodge here to-night."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The geese came hissing at his heel,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But, 'midst their noise he heard a squeal;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And looking to see from whence it came,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spied his mother down the lane.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But, just then, a boy spied him, and giving a call,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then they left off their play, and they chased the poor pig,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until he had lost both his hat and his wig.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They left him, at last, overcome with fatigue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Though," said he, "it is not for myself that I grieve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to think of the manners of these country clowns!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such conduct would never be met with in towns."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To get back his wig, he was greatly perplexed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About which and his hat, he was equally vexed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the wind, when the boys were hardest in chase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blew them both in the river, its surface to grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they seemed to mock Piggy, as there they did float;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But I'll have you," said Jack, who pushed off in a boat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When his finery reaching, the boat he upset,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I can swim," cried the blade, "and I don't mind the wet."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But, beside his own hide, both his wig and his hat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were wet and deranged; so, to remedy that,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I'll enter this cottage; here's a fire," he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I'll hang them to dry, while I lie in the bed."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the dame returned home, as he slumbered so snug,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She soon spied the gentleman under the rug,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And basted him well with a stick like a log,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turning him and his wardrobe out into a bog.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In the miry mess Piggy long struggled about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unable to rise; but at last he got out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crept to a field where fine cabbages grew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I'm hungry," said he, "I'll indulge in a few."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, just as his snout had a nice plant uptorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shot through his ear he had reason to mourn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discharged from the gun of a lad stationed there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take care of the crop, and all robbers to scare.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wounded, weary, and hungry, poor Jack now felt sad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thought of the home, so safe he once had,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where he'd plenty of food, and clean straw for his bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at night, a roof of good thatch o'er his head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He escaped from the field, though he scarcely knew how,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scampered as fast as his strength would allow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the distance, a town, long and wide he could see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ah! ah!" said Jack Swine, "that's the quarter for me."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where he walked through the streets in his comic array;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But think of his horror, oh! think of his dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, hanging immediately over his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the first butcher's shop that he chanced to discover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were the mortal remains of poor Bobby, his brother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"'Tis sad," sighed our Jack, "such a difference should be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between that unfortunate fellow and me."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But now I have hardly the heart to relate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To my dear little readers, the terrible fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That awaited poor Jack. Scarce a moment had passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he gazed on his brother, while tears trickled fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he uttered a loud and a heart-rending wail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a butcher, in blue, had caught hold of his tail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By which, and one ear, while Jack squeaked for his mother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away he was dragged, to be slain, like his brother.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The sun rose, next morning, and shed its first gleam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On exact the same spot where his brother had been;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But there, in the same place, extended and dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hung poor master Jacky, without any head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The head, too, hung near,&mdash;but without its fine wig,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And was now to be seen as the head of a pig.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many times has the butcher thought of his good luck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he'll never again capture such a gay buck.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In a certain farm-yard, not a hundred miles off,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some pigs were enjoying themselves at a trough;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They were having their dinner, or if 'twere too soon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It might be their breakfast,&mdash;it scarcely was noon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as pigs of fashion, their ears it might shock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To talk about dining before twelve o'clock.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well,&mdash;let us suppose it was breakfast,&mdash;and they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With their delicate noses were grubbing away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When up came their master, whose looks, to my thinking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betokened a love for good eating and drinking;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And 'tis not unlikely the pigs thought so too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they never so much as said "How do you do?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But went on in silence to finish their feeding,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which certainly was not a mark of good breeding;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as they thus acted, I must tell the truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though I'd rather my pigs had not been so uncouth.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">However, the master looked on at his leisure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seemed to regard them with infinite pleasure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no ill intent,&mdash;'till he happened to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One fat little lady pig, white as could be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then his mouth fairly watered, as he thought how nice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sage, onion, and apple sauce, would be a slice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that nice tempting piggy,&mdash;so, calling to Joe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who also was fond of roast pork, you must know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said, "Joe, you had better that little pig kill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before she gets bigger." Said Joe, "Sir, I will."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The pigs heard this order with great consternation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grunted, quite clearly, their disapprobation;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But master and man took no heed of their sorrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Miss was to die the day after the morrow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest, who were all in her fate interested,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now offered such comfort as pity suggested:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"They won't hurt you much," simpered one tender swain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I've heard that this killing is scarce any pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pray take some more wash, and this cabbage-stalk bite."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"No, thank you," said Piggy, "I've no appetite."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At night, when she laid herself down in her sty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain she attempted to close her bright eye:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a wink could she get through the whole of the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wept till she made herself look like a fright.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She turned first on one side, and then on the other,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And two or three times thought of waking her mother;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But this was not easy, for pigs are sound sleepers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not very willing to open their peepers.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last morning dawned, and mamma pig awoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thus poor Miss Piggy with much spirit spoke:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Dear mother, it certainly is a great pity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To kill me while I'm so young and so pretty;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if they can have such bad taste as to do it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I really don't see why I should submit to it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No one in their senses, I think, would remain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they know they are soon to be cruelly slain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are more sties than this in the world, I dare say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I think I had better at once run away."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then a grave-looking pig, of respectable age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who was always considered remarkably sage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said, "Ladies, allow me to offer a word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Respecting the orders we yesterday heard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seems that Miss does not approve of the plan<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Though such we all come to, at one time or other:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last week I thus lost my affectionate brother,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Cut off in her prime,&mdash;and we all must agree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is very unpleasant,&mdash;there can be no doubt of it,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've thought of a way by which she may get out of it:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, if she had not been so plump and good looking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They would never have fancied her ready for cooking;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if she'd get rid of these charms, I am thinking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By living awhile without eating or drinking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hides herself up in the loft, 'mongst the hay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They'll think that somebody has stole her away.<br /></span>
